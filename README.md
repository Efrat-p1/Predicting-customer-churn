# Predicting-customer-churn
Classification Project
Churned Customers are those who have decided to end their relationship with their
existing company. In our case study, we will be working on a churn dataset.

Project Description:
XYZ is a service-providing company that provides customers with a one-year
subscription plan for their product. The company wants to know if the customers will
renew the subscription for the coming year or not.

Objective:
Building a classification model on the given dataset to determine whether the customer will churn or not.
The method of scoring the model will be according to the optimal prediction for the profit expectation of the lowest log loss
